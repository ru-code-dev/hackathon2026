/**
 * Source context attached to a finding.
 *
 * A finding without its surroundings is a coordinate, and a coordinate is not something
 * anyone can judge. Four lines either side is enough to see which rule or which element
 * the value belongs to and short enough to read at a glance; the dashboard widens this on
 * demand from the same source.
 *
 * The `after` variant is produced by substituting on the affected line only. Rewriting
 * more than the one line would mean re-emitting code the developer wrote, and a diff that
 * touches lines nobody asked about does not get applied.
