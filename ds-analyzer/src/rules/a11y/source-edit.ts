/**
 * Expressing an accessibility fix as an edit to the text that is actually on the line.
 *
 * A finding becomes a diff when `actual` occurs verbatim in the source and `replaceWith`
 * says what to put there instead (`buildSnippet`). Most accessibility problems can never
 * satisfy that — the right alt text or the right label depends on what the control does —
 * but a handful are purely mechanical, and for those a reader should get a patch rather
 * than a paragraph.
 *
 * Everything here returns `null` the moment the source does not look the way it was
 * expected to. That asymmetry is the point: a missing diff costs the reader one manual
 * edit, while a wrong diff costs them their trust in every other diff in the report.
