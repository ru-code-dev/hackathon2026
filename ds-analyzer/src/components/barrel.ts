 * Flat, verbatim reading of a barrel file's `export … from '…'` statements.

 * Unlike {@link collectModuleExports}, this does not follow edges. It answers a
 * different question: *what did the kit authors write in the public entry point* —
 * which local directories are exported, which `@v-uik` packages are passed through,
 * and which symbols are explicitly renamed or type-only.
 *
 * The list is what a reviewer reads to understand the kit's API policy; the flattened
 * symbol set is what a machine matches against.
