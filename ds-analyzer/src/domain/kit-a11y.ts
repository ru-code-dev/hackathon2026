/**
 * Wire contract for `artifacts/kit-a11y.json` — what the kit's own components do about
 * accessibility, and the spacing scale its implementations actually follow.
 *
 * Both facts come from `@v-uik`, the upstream library the kit wraps, and both exist for the
 * same reason: the analyzer makes claims about consumer code that are only honest if the
 * kit has been checked first.
 *
 *  - "Replace your hand-rolled tabs with the kit's" is advice worth giving only once we can
 *    show the kit's `Tabs` handles the arrow keys. Until then it is a guess wearing a
 *    recommendation's clothes.
 *  - "13px is a magic number" needs something to be magic against. The kit publishes no
 *    spacing tier, so the alternative was a frequency heuristic over the consumer's own
 *    code — which cannot distinguish a team's spacing unit from a mistake repeated often.
 *
 * Extracted from compiled `dist/` output, so it is evidence rather than specification:
 * every record carries the file it came from and rules must not treat absence as proof of
 * absence. See `confidence` on the pattern records.
