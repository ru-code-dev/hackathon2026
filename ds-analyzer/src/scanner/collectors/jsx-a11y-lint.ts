 * The canonical JSX accessibility rules, run rather than reimplemented.
 *
 * Thirty-nine rules encoding the parts of WCAG that are decidable from one JSX element and
 * its attributes: `alt` text, positive `tabindex`, click handlers with no keyboard path,
 * anchors that are not links. None of it is novel, all of it is worth reporting, and every
 * line of it is a place where a hand-written version drifts from the specification.
 *
 * Reimplementing them was considered and rejected. This project already learned that
 * lesson the expensive way: an accessible-name check written from memory produced eleven
 * false positives out of eleven on its first real codebase, because the accname algorithm
 * is subtler than it reads. Multiplying that risk by thirty-nine would be a choice to
 * generate bugs. The plugin is the reference implementation, it tracks the spec, and it is
 * maintained by people who do only this.
 *
 * **Why this sits in the scanner and not in a rule.** Linting parses source, and the
 * pipeline's central constraint is that syntax is handled in exactly one stage. A rule that
 * ran ESLint would put a parser below the boundary the whole design rests on. What comes
 * out here is therefore a *fact about the code* — this rule fired at this position — and
 * the judgement about what it means lives in `rules/a11y/lint.ts`, as it does for every
 * other observation.
